[00:11.50] I'm going back to 505
[00:16.20] If it's a seven-hour flight or a 45-minute drive
[00:23.41] In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
[00:30.12] With your hands between your thighs
[00:40.93] Stop and wait a sec
[00:43.99] Oh, when you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect?
[00:50.78] I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
[00:57.57] Or I did last time I checked
[01:03.35] Not shy of a spark
[01:11.70] The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
[01:17.73] Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
[01:25.24] The middle of adventure is such a perfect place to start
[01:34.66] I'm going back to 505
[01:38.59] If it's a seven-hour flight or a 45-minute drive
[01:45.58] In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
[01:52.10] With your hands between your thighs
[02:28.89] But I crumble completely when you cry
[02:33.66] It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
[02:40.34] I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
[02:46.69] Take my hands off of your eyes too soon
[02:56.69] I'm going back to 505
[03:00.63] If it's a seven-hour flight or a 45-minute drive
[03:07.90] In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
[03:14.26] With your hands between your thighs and a smile
